These are modifed from the wyse-840358-01 directory.  I may have messed up when soldering my teensy to the keyboard's PCB.

As far as I know, (unsure I may have mixed up some pins) I followed the wyse-840358-01 matrix pinout and upon flashing that configuration I made the following changes to get mine fully working.

Also there are some LED issues that I need to address, which I don't think are code related. Once I get the hardware/component side figured out I will document that here along with the matrix pinout and teensy pinout that I'm currently using.
